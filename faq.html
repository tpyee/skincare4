                    Since 2020, Beauty Skincare has cleansed, cleared, conditioned, prevented, firmed, protected, repaired, and renewed 
                    skin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beauty Skincare is a popular skincare among many since it was designed by a skincare professional with the mindset of 
                    "let's do this correctly." We believe that if you're going to do anything, make it count, and that's exactly what we do 
                    with our products.
                </p>
                <p>Beauty Skincare is honest and transparent about the quality of its products and why it is a safe choice.
                    We genuinely care about your skincare concerns, and we want you to feel confident not just in using our products, but 
                    also in recommending them to others!
                </p>

                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Having A Question?</h2>
                <p style="text-align: center;">We prepared some frequently asked questions to solve your problem!</p>
                <br>

                <p><b>What is the most key element of our products?</b></p>
                <p>
                    Our ingredients are of the utmost importance. What you put on your skin also goes into your skin, having a significant 
                    impact on the rest of your body. It's only natural that we use high-quality plant-based components to allow your body to 
                    naturally assimilate the results. Not only are toxic chemicals excluded from Beauty Skincare, but also artificial dyes, 
                    synthetic scents, parabens, gluten, phthalates, and preservatives. Beauty Skincare has always been dedicated to providing 
                    ethically sound, high-quality skincare that actually works.
                </p>

                <p><b>Do you provide free samples of your products?</b></p> 
                <p>We provide specifically crafted samples that can be ordered at the time of purchase.</p>

                <p><b>Can you tell me when a product that is currently out of stock returns?</b></p>
                <p>
                    We love our beauty products and understand how annoying it is when they are out of stock. Once the item is back in stock, you 
                    will receive an automated email notification.
                </p>

                <p><b>Is it possible to obtain a product's ingredient list?</b></p>
                <p>Yes. You may see the ingredients for each product under the designated product page.</p>
