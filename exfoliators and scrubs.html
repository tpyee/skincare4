                This 3-in-1 formula offers an enzyme, acid, and physical exfoliation to deliver all the benefits without any downtime 
                (no irritation and no redness). Expect instant and long-term results with this game-changing product after just 1 use. 
                The hero ingredient for giving Yo Detox its unique gray hue is charcoal which is the ultimate skincare hero that has 
                multiple benefits your skin will love. The oil-absorbing properties work wonders to clean excess oil from your pores as 
                well as the skin’s surface. It also removes grease and residue effectively so your pores will look snatched and feel more 
                refined. Other key ingredients include AHA and BHA’s which exfoliate dead skin cells and reduces dark spots for more even 
                skin. Pineapple and papaya enzymes gently exfoliate while smoothing the skin, plus reduces the appearance of dark spots. 
                Witch hazel is an oil-reducing astringent to help relieve breakouts and tighten pores.
